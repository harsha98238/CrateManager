done:
increase time to check the crate sensor
- if( flag3CrateEjection1 == true and millis() - timer2CrateEjection1 > 1700 


if( copStorage1Count >= numCopStorage1 and crate1error == false and digitalRead(crate1) == false /*and Tray1EmptyFlag == false and Tray2EmptyFlag == false*/)
- reading crate1 to be avoided
